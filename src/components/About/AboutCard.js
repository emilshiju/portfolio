         <p>I am a full-stack developer focused on the MERN stack with two years of hands-on experience. After completing my higher secondary education, I taught myself the MERN stack and have successfully completed two industry-level projects along with several mini-projects. Completing these projects has enhanced my ability to research and implement new technologies independently, without relying on others. Moreover, my problem-solving skills allow me to find better solutions for every challenge I encounter. I am eager to learn new technologies and excited to apply my skills and hard work to future projects.</p>
